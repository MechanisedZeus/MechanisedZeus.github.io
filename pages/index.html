  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I origionally didn't care much for computers and computer scence however as I became older I realised how powerfull these simple machines are. Similar to most people my first program was likely a "hello world" 
  program likely written in basic, I then soon started lerning Python. After a couple of years studying GCSE computer science and eventually finishing my GCSEs and I decided to study A-Level computer science as well
  as physics and a CTECH in engineering. As part of the A-Level qualification you are required to complete a programing project. The only requirements to this was that the program had a graphical user interface other than
  that that the possibilities were limitless. After some time decidng what i could do I came up with the idea of a facial recognition system, shorly after coming up with this idea I started
  thinking about how a similar system could be intergrated with a neural network. It was because of this that I decided to swap my project to a neural network that was capable of identifying neumrical digits. I ultametly
  settled on this because it meant that I wouldn't have to learn computer vision, this is becasue the input for the neural network would be given in the form of a filepath leading to the input image. It was because of this
  project that I started my journy into neural networks.
