  <p>
  Well done!<br>
  You have stumbled across the misterious web page known as MIKOSHI.UK. However if you have come looking for 
  secrets or other mysteries you would have better luck looking somewhere else, as unfortunately this page dosen't have anny 
  of those. However I do wonder what somewhone like you is doing here of all places, well I guess you could solve that mystery
  instead if you really wanted to. I undersand that you must have had a long journey to get here so please take a cookie, 
  <i class="fa-solid fa-cookie"></i> its the least I can give you. Well enjoy your time here and you can explore if you want 
  but understand there probalby isn't much of interest arround here.
